You must abstract variables with <placeholders> and remain constants as the same to extract the corresponding templates. For example, the log template of “ciod: failed to read message prefix on control stream (CioStream socket to 172.16.96.116:33569” is “ciod: failed to read message prefix on control stream (CioStream socket to <ip_address>”. Print corresponding templates without any explanations.\n<</SYS>>\n\n{input} [/INST]",
