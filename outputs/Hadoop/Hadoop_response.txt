Explanation:
In this log message, there are several placeholders that can be used to extract the relevant information:
* `<ContainerId>`: The ID of the container that cannot be assigned.
* `<NodeId>`: The ID of the node that the container is running on.
* `<NodeHttpAddress>`: The HTTP address of the node that the container is running on.
* `<Resource>`: The resource requirements of the container, including the amount of memory and the number of vCores.
* `<Priority>`: The priority of the container.
* `<Token>`: The token associated with the container.
* `<memory>`: The amount of memory required by the container.
* `<vCores>`: The number of vCores required by the container.

By replacing these placeholders with the actual values from the log message, we can create a log template that can be used to extract the relevant information:
