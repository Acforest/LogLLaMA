Log template: [BEGIN] inconsistent nodesets <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> [END]
Explanation:
In this log message, each token is either a constant (common part or keyword) or a variable (dynamic number or parameter). The variables are represented by placeholders, which are enclosed in angle brackets (< >).
The log message can be parsed as follows:
* [BEGIN] is a constant keyword.
* inconsistent nodesets is a constant common part.
* node-160 is a variable, represented by a placeholder <num>.
* 0x0001edfe is a constant hexadecimal value.
* <ok> is a constant keyword.
* node-161 is a variable, represented by a placeholder <num>.
* 0x1001fdfe is a constant hexadecimal value.
* <ok> is a constant keyword.
* node-162 is a variable, represented by a placeholder <num>.
* 0x1001fdfe is a constant hexadecimal value.
* <ok> is a constant keyword.
* node-163 is a variable, represented by a placeholder <num>.
* 0x1001fdfe is a constant hexadecimal value.
* <ok> is a constant keyword.
* [END] is a constant keyword.

Therefore, the log template for this log message is: [BEGIN] inconsistent nodesets <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> [END]</s>"

Log template: [BEGIN] inconsistent nodesets <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> [END]
Explanation:
In this log message, each token is either a constant (common part or keyword) or a variable (dynamic number or parameter). The variables are represented by placeholders, which are enclosed in angle brackets (< >).
The log message can be parsed as follows:
* [BEGIN] is a constant keyword.
* inconsistent nodesets is a constant phrase.
* node-32 is a variable, represented by a placeholder <num>.
* 0x00000002 is a constant hexadecimal value.
* <ok> is a constant keyword.
* node-34 is a variable, represented by a placeholder <num>.
* 0x000001fe is a constant hexadecimal value.
* <ok> is a constant keyword.
* node-33 is a variable, represented by a placeholder <num>.
* 0x000001fe is a constant hexadecimal value.
* <ok> is a constant keyword.
* node-35 is a variable, represented by a placeholder <num>.
* 0x000001fe is a constant hexadecimal value.
* <ok> is a constant keyword.
* [END] is a constant keyword.

Therefore, the log template for this log message is [BEGIN] inconsistent nodesets <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> <num>, 0x<hex>, <ok> [END].</s>"

Explanation:
* ""node node-45"" is a constant token, representing the name of the node that detected the network connection.
* ""has detected"" is a verb token, indicating the action being performed.
* ""available network connection"" is a noun token, representing the event being detected.
* ""on network 5.5.224.0"" is a prepositional phrase, providing additional information about the network connection.
* ""via interface alt0"" is a prepositional phrase, providing additional information about the interface used to connect to the network.

So, the log template for this message would be: [BEGIN] NIFF: node <node-45> has detected an available network connection on network <network> via interface <interface> [END]</s>"

Explanation:
* ""node node-77"" is a constant token, representing the name of the node that detected the network connection.
* ""has detected"" is a verb token, indicating the action being performed.
* ""an available network connection"" is a noun phrase, representing the type of connection being detected.
* ""on network 5.5.224.0"" is a prepositional phrase, providing additional information about the network connection.
* ""via interface alt0"" is a prepositional phrase, providing additional information about the interface used to detect the connection.

So, the log template for this message would be: [BEGIN] NIFF: node <node-77> has detected an available network connection on network <network-number> via interface <interface-name> [END]</s>"
