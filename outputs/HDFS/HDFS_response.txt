Explanation:
In this log message, the variables are:
* `blockMap`: This is a dynamic variable that represents the block map being updated.
* `10.251.106.50`: This is the IP address of the node that is being updated.
* `50010`: This is the port number of the node that is being updated.
* `-2530087534157630851`: This is the size of the block being added to the block map.
So, the log template would be: [BEGIN] BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: <IP address>:<port> is added to blk_<size> [END]
In this case, the log template would be [BEGIN] BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: 10.251.106.50:50010 is added to blk_-2530087534157630851 size 67108864 [END]</s>

Explanation:
In this log message, the variables are:
* `10.251.39.242`: the IP address of the node that updated the block map
* `50010`: the port number of the node that updated the block map
* `-4110733372292809607`: the size of the block that was added to the block map
So, the log template would be: [BEGIN] BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: <IP address>:<port> is added to blk_<size> [END]
In this case, the results would be: [BEGIN] BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: 10.251.39.242:50010 is added to blk_-4110733372292809607 size 67108864 [END]</s>

Explanation:
The log message contains the following tokens:
* 10.251.39.144:50010 - IP address and port of the server that served the block
* blk_-8187008844253719581 - the block number being served
* /10.251.91.32 - the file path of the block being served
By replacing the placeholders with the actual values, we get the following log template:

Explanation:
In this log message, the variables are:
* `blockMap`: This is a dynamic variable that represents the block map being updated.
* `10.251.26.177`: This is the IP address of the node that is adding the block to the block map.
* `50010`: This is the port number of the node that is adding the block to the block map.
* `-2402036602753320612`: This is the size of the block being added to the block map.
So, the log template would be: [BEGIN] BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: <IP address>:<port> is added to blk_<size> [END]</s>

Explanation:
The log message contains the following tokens:
* 10.251.91.84:50010: The IP address and port number of the server that served the block.

Explanation:
In this log message, the variables are:
* `blockMap`: This is a dynamic variable that represents the block map being updated.
* `10.251.106.37`: This is the IP address of the node that is adding the block to the block map.
* `50010`: This is the port number of the node that is adding the block to the block map.
* `-4510259260131940043`: This is the size of the block being added to the block map.

Log template: [BEGIN] BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: <IP address>:<port> is added to blk_<size> [END]
Results:

Explanation:
In this log message, the variables are:
* `10.251.66.102`: the IP address of the node that updated the block map
* `50010`: the port number of the node that updated the block map
* `-1932467763723526131`: the size of the block that was added to the block map
So, the log template would be: [BEGIN] BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: <IP address>:<port> is added to blk_<size> [END]
In this case, the results would be: [BEGIN] BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: 10.251.66.102:50010 is added to blk_-1932467763723526131 size 67108864 [END]</s>
