Log message: [BEGIN] Got user-level KeeperException when processing sessionid:0x34ed93485090001 type:create cxid:0x55b8bb0f zxid:0x100000010 txntype:-1 reqpath:n/a Error Path:/home/curi/.zookeeper Error:KeeperErrorCode = NodeExists for /home/curi/.zookeeper [END]
Log template: [BEGIN] Got KeeperException when processing sessionid:<num>, type:<type>, cxid:<cxid>, zxid:<zxid>, txntype:<txntype>, reqpath:<reqpath>, Error Path:<path>, Error:KeeperErrorCode = <error_code> [END]
In this case, the log message can be abstracted as follows:

* Type: create
* Cxid: 0x55b8bb0f
* Zxid: 0x100000010
* Txntype: -1
* Reqpath: n/a
* Error Path: /home/curi/.zookeeper
* Error: KeeperErrorCode = NodeExists for /home/curi/.zookeeper
So the log template would be: [BEGIN] Got KeeperException when processing sessionid:<num>, type:<type>, cxid:<cxid>, zxid:<zxid>, txntype:<txntype>, reqpath:<reqpath>, Error Path:<path>, Error:KeeperErrorCode = <error_code> [END]</s>
