Sure! Here's the abstracted template for the given log message:
```
`{PacketResponder} for block {blk_${random_num}} terminating`
```
Here, I've replaced the specific values in the log message (e.g., "1", "block blk_38865049064139660") with placeholders ({PacketResponder}, {blk_${random_num}}) to create a more general template that can be applied to similar log messages.
 Sure! Here's the abstracted template for the given log message:
```
`{LogType} Responder {Number} for block {BlockHash} terminating`
```
Now, let me explain what each placeholder represents:

* `{LogType}`: This represents the type of log message, which in this case is "PacketResponder".
* `{Number}`: This represents the number associated with the responder, which is "0" in this example.
* `{BlockHash}`: This represents the hash of the block that the responder is handling, which is "-6952295868487656571" in this example.

So, the final template would be:
```
`PacketResponder 0 for block -6952295868487656571 terminating`
```
 Sure! Here's the abstracted template for the given log message:
```
BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: {IP address}:{port} is added to blk_{block ID} size {size}
```
The placeholders in this template are:

* `{IP address}`: The IP address of the machine that added the block.
* `{port}`: The port number on which the block was added.
* `{block ID}`: The unique identifier for the block that was added.
* `{size}`: The size of the block that was added.
 Sure! Here's the abstracted template for the given log message:
```
`{prefix}Responder {number} for block {block_id} terminating`
```
Where:

* `{prefix}`: Packet
* `{number}`: 2
* `{block_id}`: blk_8229193803249955061

The input log's template delimited by backticks would be:
```
`PacketResponder 2 for block blk_8229193803249955061 terminating`
```
 Sure! Here's the abstracted template for the given log message:
```sql
`PacketResponder {num} for block {block_id} terminating`
```
Where:

* `{num}` is a placeholder for the number of the PacketResponder instance (in this case, 2).
* `{block_id}` is a placeholder for the ID of the block that the PacketResponder is operating on (in this case, `-6670958622368987959`).
 Sure! Here's the abstracted template for the given log message:
```sql
BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: {IP address}:{port} is added to blk_{block ID} size {size}
```
Where:

* {IP address} is a placeholder for the IP address of the node that is adding the block.
* {port} is a placeholder for the port number of the node that is adding the block.
* {block ID} is a placeholder for the unique identifier of the block that is being added.
* {size} is a placeholder for the size of the block that is being added.
 Sure! Here's the abstracted template for the given log message:
```sql
BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: {IP Address}:{Port} is added to blk_{Block ID} size {Size}
```
Where:

* {IP Address} is a placeholder for the IP address `10.251.203.80`.
* {Port} is a placeholder for the port number `50010`.
* {Block ID} is a placeholder for the block ID `7888946331804732825`.
* {Size} is a placeholder for the block size `67108864`.
 Sure! Here's the extracted template from the given log message:
```
BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: {IP address}:{port} is added to blk_{block ID} size {block size}
```
The placeholders in this template are:

* `{IP address}`: The IP address of the node that added the block.
* `{port}`: The port number of the node that added the block.
* `{block ID}`: The unique identifier for the block that was added.
* `{block size}`: The size of the block that was added.
 Sure! Here's the extracted template from the given log message:
```sql
{ PacketResponder } for block { blk_<numbers> } terminating
```
Please provide me with the actual values for `{ PacketResponder }` and `{ blk_<numbers> }` so I can fill them in and give you the complete template.
 Sure! Here's the extracted template for the given log message:
```sql
Received block {block_id} of size {size} from {ip_address}
```
The placeholders in this template are:

* `{block_id}`: This represents the unique identifier for the received block, which is `blk_3587508140051953248` in the given log message.
* `{size}`: This represents the size of the received block, which is `67108864` in the given log message.
* `{ip_address}`: This represents the IP address of the node that sent the block, which is `/10.251.42.84` in the given log message.
 Sure! Here's the extracted template from the given log message:
```sql
Received block {block_id} of size {size} from {ip_address}
```
The placeholders in this template are:

* `{block_id}`: blk_5402003568334525940
* `{size}`: 67108864
* `{ip_address}`: 10.251.214.112
 Sure! Here's the extracted template from the given log message:
```
`Receiving block {block_id} src: {source_ip}:{source_port} dest: {destination_ip}:{destination_port}`
```
The placeholders in the template are:

* {block_id}
* {source_ip}
* {source_port}
* {destination_ip}
* {destination_port}

The log message you provided contains the following values for these placeholders:

* {block_id}: blk_5792489080791696128
* {source_ip}: 10.251.30.6
* {source_port}: 33145
* {destination_ip}: 10.251.30.6
* {destination_port}: 50010

So, the input log's template delimited by backticks would be:
```
`Receiving block blk_5792489080791696128 src: 10.251.30.6:33145 dest: 10.251.30.6:50010`
```
 Sure! Here's the abstracted template for the given log message:
```
`{src_ip} ({src_port}) - {dst_ip} ({dst_port})`
```
The placeholders in the template are:

* `{src_ip}`: The source IP address (e.g., `/10.251.111.130`)
* `{src_port}`: The source port number (e.g., `49851`)
* `{dst_ip}`: The destination IP address (e.g., `/10.251.111.130`)
* `{dst_port}`: The destination port number (e.g., `50010`)

So, the extracted template is:
```
` Receiving block blk_1724757848743533110 src: /10.251.111.130:49851 dest: /10.251.111.130:50010`
```
 Sure! Here's the abstracted template for the given log message:
```sql
BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: {ipAddress}:{port} is added to blk_{blockId} size {blockSize}
```
Here, we have used the following placeholders:

* `{ipAddress}`: This placeholder represents the IP address of the client who sent the request to add a stored block. In the example log message, this value is `10.251.110.8`.
* `{port}`: This placeholder represents the port number that the client used to communicate with the NameNode. In the example log message, this value is `50010`.
* `{blockId}`: This placeholder represents the unique identifier of the block that was added to the block map. In the example log message, this value is `8015913224713045110`.
* `{blockSize}`: This placeholder represents the size of the block in bytes. In the example log message, this value is `67108864`.
